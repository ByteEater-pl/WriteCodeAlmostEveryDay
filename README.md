Once upon a time I decided to try to write code and put it on GitHub almost (to be realistic) every day. In any repository â€“ this one is for stuff, mostly exercises, that doesn't fit better elsewhere. How's it been going? Periodically.

Many attempts are unfinished.

Some are attempts at implementing quicksort in a language new (sometimes completely, in the sense of not having written any code in it before) with pessimistically logarithmic recursion depth. Turns out it's often too ambitious for me, I should start with something simpler.
